# TravelCheck
A simple and intuitive world travel advisory application to help world travelers determine if their destination is safe to travel to.

## Description

As someone who intends to travel internationally, I want to be able to access real-time information on the condition of potential destinations, especially in regard to potential risks that I might not be aware of, especially in regards to COVID-19. As a result, Iâ€™m capable of making informed decisions on where and when I should travel in the future.
