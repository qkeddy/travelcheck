# TravelCheck
A simple and intuitive world travel advisory application to help world travelers determine if their destination is safe to travel to.

## Description

As someone who intends to travel internationally, I want to be able to access real-time information on the condition of potential destinations, especially in regard to potential risks that I might not be aware of, especially in regards to COVID-19. As a result, Iâ€™m capable of making informed decisions on where and when I should travel in the future.

## Usage

This application can be found that the following [link](https://qkeddy.github.io/travelcheck/).

When you first arrive on the page, there will be a country dropdown and a submit button.

To get COVID-19 and travel safety data for a specific country, select the country you want from the dropdown and click submit. Countries are listed by continent and then in alphabetical order.

After clicking submit, data for the country that you input will be displayed on the screen and that country will appear in left-hand column under that submit button.

As you continue to search for countries, TravelCheck will store your search history in the left-hand column. Simply click on the country name to view a country that you have already searched. Your search history will be stored in local storage, so you can feel free to leave and return to this page without losing your search history.
